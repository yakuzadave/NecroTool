Define Project Scope and Goals

Establish the primary objectives of the simulation, such as text-based interaction, narrative elements, and rule enforcement.
Decide on simulating core Necromunda mechanics with full fidelity to the official ruleset.
Define the target audience: experienced Necromunda players seeking a fully faithful simulation.
Design Game Rules Representation

Turn Order and Activation: Represent the alternating activation system, ensuring fairness and strict adherence to Necromunda rules.
Detailed Rules Implementation: Translate Necromunda rules exactly as stated, without abstraction. Include comprehensive mechanics for movement, cover, line-of-sight, injury, and all gang-specific traits.

Grid-Based System: Implement a grid-based text representation of the battlefield, defining each tile as a position with specific traits (e.g., open space, cover, elevation).
Environment Elements: Define and represent map elements such as obstacles, cover, hazardous zones, elevation, and destructible terrain accurately according to the game rules.
Map Updates: Write logic to update the map dynamically after player actions, including modifications for destroyed cover, elevation changes, and ongoing environmental effects.
Terrain Effects: Implement precise terrain rules for movement (e.g., Difficult Terrain, hazardous terrain effects).
Gang and Character Modeling

Attribute Representation: Define all key attributes (Movement, Ballistic Skill, Weapon Skill, Strength, Toughness, Wounds, Initiative, etc.) in detail for each fighter.
Weapons and Equipment: Implement a detailed inventory system for weapons, ammo, and gear. Include stats like range, strength, AP, ammo checks, and specific traits (e.g., Blaze, Knockback).
Special Rules: Accurately implement gang and character-specific special rules (e.g., "Fearsome" for Goliaths, "Spring Up" for Escher).
Gang Types: Represent each gang according to the official rules, including strengths, weaknesses, and exclusive skills.
Turn Sequence and Action System

Initiative and Priority: Develop a function to determine which gang activates first and manage alternating activations.
Actions per Turn: Implement all possible actions for each fighter (Move, Shoot, Charge, Take Cover, Crawl, Stand Up, etc.).
Action Point Management: Track actions precisely, ensuring rules such as "Ready" and "Engaged" are correctly enforced.
Combat System

Melee and Ranged Combat: Implement combat mechanics for melee and ranged, including modifiers for range, cover, skills, and special abilities.
Hit Rolls: Accurately simulate hit rolls, using BS/WS and incorporating modifiers for visibility, cover, and range.
Armor and Damage Resolution: Implement armor saves, AP values, injury rolls, and critical hits. Represent Flesh Wounds, Seriously Injured, and Out of Action results.
Status Effects: Track all status effects (e.g., Pinned, Seriously Injured, Engaged) and their impact on fighter abilities.
Text-Based User Interface

Command System: Develop text commands to control gang members (e.g., move A1 to B2, attack, end turn), ensuring strict adherence to Necromunda's sequence of play.
User Input Parsing: Write a parser to interpret user input and execute appropriate game logic with validation to ensure adherence to game rules.
Visual Representation: Ensure actions, results, and map states are represented clearly with consistent formatting.
Environmental Effects

Dynamic Terrain Changes: Implement rules for destructible terrain (e.g., cover collapsing) and how it impacts movement or visibility.
Weather Effects: Include environmental effects such as ash storms, toxic gases, and radiation zones as per Necromunda campaign settings.
Event Triggers: Incorporate random events from the official rulebook, including environmental hazards triggered by specific rolls or actions.
Victory Conditions and Scoring

Objective Tracking: Implement mission-specific objectives (e.g., capturing loot, assassinations) exactly as defined in official scenarios.
Victory Points Calculation: Create a detailed system to calculate victory points according to official rules and objectives.
Alternate End Conditions: Ensure alternate game-ending conditions, such as "bottling out" or achieving a specific objective, are faithfully represented.
Narrative Flavor and Random Events

Flavor Text: Add descriptive text for each action and significant event to enhance immersion (e.g., narrative flavor for critical hits or terrain destruction).
Random Events: Develop a table of random events based on the core and expansion rulebooks for Necromunda.
Campaign Events: Add narrative-driven events if players use this simulation for campaign play, tracking character progression and changes between games.
Define All Dice Rolls Needed for Simulation

Weapon Attack Rolls: Define attack rolls, modifiers, and any special rules affecting hits.
Wound and Armor Rolls: Implement wound rolls based on Strength vs. Toughness and armor saves with modifiers such as AP values.
Injury Rolls: Create injury tables, including results like Out of Action, Captured, or Serious Injury.
Vehicle Rolls: Include detailed vehicle rules, handling crashes, critical hits, and hazardous movement.
Skill Tests: Implement rolls for skills (e.g., Willpower, Cool, Leadership) for morale, Breaking tests, and special scenarios.
Blast and Scatter Rolls: Implement deviation and scatter for blast weapons and templates as per official rules.
Campaign Rolls: Include rolls for injuries, equipment acquisition, and territory results.
Testing and Debugging

Unit Testing for Rules: Write unit tests for all core game mechanics, ensuring that every element adheres to official Necromunda rules.
Simulation Runs: Playtest full rounds to identify any deviations from official mechanics.
Balancing Checks: Verify the correct implementation of game mechanics, ensuring that modifiers and special rules interact as intended.
Quality of Life Improvements

Command Shortcuts: Implement shortcuts for common actions while maintaining fidelity to rules.
Undo Functionality: Add an undo function for incorrect commands while ensuring no violation of rules (e.g., allowing undo only before any dice roll).
Save and Load Game State: Create save/load functionality, allowing users to pick up games where they left off.
Documentation

User Guide: Develop a detailed guide for using the simulation, explaining each command and how it reflects the Necromunda rules.
Rules Documentation: Fully document all rules implemented, explaining any clarifications needed for the text interface.
Developer Notes: Maintain internal documentation for developers to understand how rules are applied within the code.
